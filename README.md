## üåç Overview

The HR Workforce Risk Assessment Tool addresses a critical business challenge: **protecting organizations from talent loss and knowledge gaps**. With an aging workforce, many companies face significant risks from retirement waves, but lack the tools to quantify and mitigate these risks proactively.

### The Problem
- **65% of critical knowledge** resides in employees nearing retirement
- Replacing a single senior employee costs **150-200% of their annual salary**
- Most organizations lack visibility into their workforce risk exposure
- Traditional succession planning is reactive, not proactive

### The Solution
A comprehensive, data-driven tool that:
1. **Assesses** your organization's baseline risk level
2. **Quantifies** the financial impact of employee turnover
3. **Simulates** different retention strategies
4. **Provides** AI-powered recommendations via an intelligent chatbot
5. **Generates** actionable reports for stakeholder presentations

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

3. **Open locally**
Simply open `index.html` in your browser, or use a local server:
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js http-server
npx http-server
```

**GitHub Pages:**
- Note: GitHub Pages doesn't support serverless functions
- You'll need to modify the chat feature or use a separate API endpoint

## üõ† How It Works

### Risk Calculation Model

1. **Risk Score** = (Industry √ó 0.5) + (Age √ó 0.3) + (Size √ó 0.2)
   - Industry multipliers: Manufacturing (4), Healthcare (4), Tech (5), etc.
   - Age multipliers: 35-36 (1) to 47-50 (5)
   - Size multipliers: 50 employees (1) to 1000+ (5)

2. **Employees Retiring Soon** = Total √ó (Avg Age / 100) √ó 0.5
   - Assumes linear correlation over 5-year window

3. **Critical Skills at Risk** = Retiring √ó (Industry Multiplier √ó 0.1)
   - Higher for specialized industries

4. **Replacement Cost** = Retiring √ó RM 15,000 per employee
   - Based on SHRM research: 50-200% of salary

5. **Retention Investment** = Replacement Cost √ó 0.20
   - Research shows 15-25% effectiveness

### Strategy Simulation

**Investment Impact:**
- Risk Reduction: Base √ó (1 - Investment% √ó 0.25) √ó KT Multiplier
- Cost Reduction: Base √ó (1 - Investment% √ó 0.5) √ó KT Multiplier
- Retention Boost: Base + (Investment% √ó 15%)

**Knowledge Transfer Programs:**
- None: 1.0 multiplier, RM 0, +0% retention
- Basic: 0.9 multiplier, RM 20K, +2% retention
- Advanced: 0.75 multiplier, RM 50K, +5% retention
